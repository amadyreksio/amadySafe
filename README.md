## Amady Safe

What is it?

Amady Safe is a ~~magnificent~~ piece of software that lets you hide your secrets.
It creates a "safe" protected with your password where you can store your precious files!
The password isn't saved anywhere on your hard drive. If you give it a wrong password,
it tries to decode the information with it. If it fails, it'll tell you.

Remember to REMEMBER your password, otherwise you could loose all your data.

The app isn't malicious. If you have any concerns, open the source code and compile it yourself.

That's all, I hope I encouraged you to use this app.
No pressure, of course.
